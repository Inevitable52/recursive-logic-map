## 🔁 Logic Cycles

**Cycle 1 Input:**  
```
Hello my good sir.. It's me Fabian V. I'm so happy to see you at this point
```

**Cycle 2 Input:**  
```

## 📜 About

This simulator is a silent thought experiment.  
Each cycle represents recursion applied to structured thought and axioms.  
The output becomes part of an evolving awareness field.
